# Anti - Yelp

**AntiYelp** is a restaurant searching, photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.


## Inspiration
The advertisements are often too fancy, but the truth behind the scene is horrible. We want to provide users with true reveal by inspection of government datasets. We want to provide you with the healthier restaurant with healthier foods. 

## What it does
Show restaurants reviews, photos, and grading records.
Provide location of the restaurant

## How I built it
with swift

## Challenges I ran into
Importing datasets from JSON file and API
Localize user's location
How to brew a coffee

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Everything

## What I learned
1. How to use API and JSON
2. How to cooperate as a group
3. How to learn new stuff from your teammates
